            <h1>Coding Temple Goals</h1>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>I am hoping to gain the skills necessary to become a software engineer. Not only do I love working in tech, but I've always <br>loved computers, and immersing myself in a coding bootcamp will give me the skills necessary to begin my career as a SWE.</p>
            <br>
            <p>While I've dabbled in online courses over the years (and even considered minoring in CS back in college), I've never taken<br>the full leap and committed myself to learning how to code. I learn best in a structured environment, which is why an immersive<br>bootcamp program like Coding Temple is a perfect fit for me.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I'm extremely excited to continue my journey on the path to becoming a software engineer. Coding Temple will accelerate my <br>learning by allowing me to focus purely on the program itself, and when I come out of it, I will be thinking and learning like<br>a software engineer would.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h1>Beyond the Program</h1>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>I fully anticipate getting a software engineering job sometime after the completion of my bootcamp. In an ideal world, <br>I will get a SWE job at my current company. But if I have to leave to start my programming career elsewhere, then that is exactly<br> what I'll do.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I'm not too worried about how long it may take me to find a job in this industry. I understand that entry-level SWE jobs are harder to <br>come by in 2023 then they were in 2020 or even 2021. I plan on working very hard to improve my skills so that when the right <br> opportunity comes along, I will look like the very best candidate for the job</p>
            <br>
            <p>Freelance coding and consulting is an excellent way to work on my skills as a programmer after the bootcamp (and before landing that <br>first SWE job). Not only will it build my resume and improve my abilities, but it could blossom into a legitimate side-hustle, depending <br>of course on what route I decide to take.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Overall, I am just extremely excited to get going with this next phase in my career. It was a blast throwing together this portfolio website, and I<br>can't wait to see what I will be capable of creating down the line!</p>
